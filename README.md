## 🎨 Customization

### Theme

The website uses a custom theme with primary colors and dark mode support. You can modify the theme in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Content

Update the content in the respective component files:

- `src/components/hero.tsx` - Hero section content
- `src/components/experience.tsx` - Experience timeline
- `src/components/projects.tsx` - Project showcase
- `src/components/skills.tsx` - Skills and expertise

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive with breakpoints for:

- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

## 🚀 Deployment

The website is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with the following settings:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `next build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

## 🧪 Testing

- `npm run test:unit` — Vitest + Testing Library unit tests (`*.test.ts(x)` next to the source)
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright end-to-end tests in `e2e/` (run against a production build)
- `npm run test` — both suites
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`

Every pull request runs lint, typecheck, unit tests, and the Playwright suite via
`.github/workflows/test.yml`, and merging is blocked until they pass.
